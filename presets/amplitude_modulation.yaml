name: "Amplitude Modulation"
description: |
  Demonstrates amplitude modulation (AM) using Phase 3 math components.
  A high-frequency carrier signal (sine wave at 5 Hz) is modulated by a
  slower modulating signal (sine wave at 0.5 Hz). The Multiplier component
  performs the modulation by multiplying the carrier and modulator together.
  The result is then passed through a Limiter to clip the output to a safe
  range of -1.0 to +1.0 volts, demonstrating signal limiting/clipping.

  AM equation: output = carrier(t) * modulator(t)
  Where: carrier(t) = sin(2*pi*5*t) and modulator(t) = sin(2*pi*0.5*t)

    type: VoltageSource
    params:
      frequency: 5.0      # 5 Hz carrier frequency

  # Low-frequency modulating signal (0.5 Hz sine wave)
  - name: MODULATOR
    type: VoltageSource
    params:
      frequency: 0.5      # 0.5 Hz modulation frequency
      amplitude: 1.0      # 1V peak amplitude

  # Four-quadrant multiplier for AM modulation
  # Output = carrier * modulator (produces classic AM envelope)
  - name: AM_MULT
    type: Multiplier

      scale: 1.0          # Unity scale

  # Limiter clips output to safe voltage range
  # Demonstrates signal limiting when modulated signal exceeds bounds
  - name: OUTPUT_LIMITER
    type: Limiter
    params:
      min_val: -1.0       # Clip negative peaks at -1V
      max_val: 1.0        # Clip positive peaks at +1V
