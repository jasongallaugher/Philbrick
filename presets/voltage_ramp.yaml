name: "Voltage Ramp Generator"
description: |
  Simple integrator with constant DC input demonstrating linear ramp output.
  When a constant voltage is applied to an integrator, the output grows linearly
  with time: output = initial + (input * gain * time).
  This is the fundamental building block for timing circuits and sweep generators.
  With input = 1.0V and gain = 1.0, output increases by 1V per second.

components:
  # DC voltage source (constant 1.0V)
  # Setting frequency = 0 produces a constant DC output at the amplitude level
  - name: DC_SOURCE
    type: VoltageSource
    params:
      frequency: 0.0    # DC (no oscillation)
      amplitude: 1.0    # 1.0 volt constant output

  # Integrator converts constant input to linear ramp
  - name: RAMP_INT
    type: Integrator
    params:
      initial: 0.0     # Start at 0V
      gain: 1.0        # 1V/s per 1V input

patches:
  # DC source -> integrator input
