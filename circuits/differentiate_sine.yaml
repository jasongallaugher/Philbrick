# Example circuit using the Differentiator subcircuit
# Demonstrates subcircuit instantiation and imports
#
# This circuit differentiates a sine wave, which should produce
# a cosine wave (since d/dt sin(t) = cos(t))

name: Differentiate Sine Wave
description: |
  Demonstrates the Differentiator subcircuit by differentiating
  a sine wave input. The output should approximate a cosine wave.
